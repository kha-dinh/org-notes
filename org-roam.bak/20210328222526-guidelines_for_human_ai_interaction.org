#+date:

* Paper: Guidelines for Human-AI interaction
+ Authors: Saleema Amershi et. al., Microsoft Research
+ Published in: CHI 2019
** Overview
+ 18 design guidelines for human-AI interaction is composed from over 150 design recommendations from over 20 years of learning in AI design
+ The guidelines are validated through multiple rounds user study
  - The results verify he relavant of them and reveals gaps in our knowledge about HAI

* Motivation
+ /AI-infused systems/ ( System that have AI features ) have uncertaintes that violates traditional UI design principles
+ Over 20 years, numerous guidelines and recommendations has been proposed for HAI in the industries and academia
  - However, there are still mistakes made in various AI interfaces
  - Which shows that designers and developers still struggle with creating effective AI-infuse systems
+ A shared guidelines is useful for people to design and evaluate AI-infused systems
* Phase 1: Consolidation of guidelines
+ Guidines are gathered from three sources:
  + Review of industry AI products
  + Recent public articles about AI desgin
  + Relavent papers about AI design
+ 168 design guidelines are obtained, which are consolidated into 20
+ The guidelines are organized into four categories based on when during the user's interaction they are applied:
  + Initially
  + During interraction
  + When wrong
  + Over time
* Phase 2: Modified Heuristic Evaluation
+ 11 team members participated
+ The evaluators examine 13 AI-infused products and try to identify both applications and violations of the guidelines
+ The findings are reviewd, and the number is further reduced to 18
* Phase 3: User study
+ A user study with 49 HCI particioners is conducted
** Procedure
+ A heuristic evaluation: each participant is asign to an AI product and asked to find applications and violations of each guideline
* Phase 3: User study
** Products
+ Products are selected using a maximum-variance sampling strategy:
  + Top ranking apps, software and websites in the U.S. is searched
  + Products are grouped by their use case, resulting in 10 categories, 2 product each
  + Select prominent AI-drivent feature to evaluate per product

* Phase 3: User study
** Participants
+ People at large software company with at least 1 year experience in HCI
+ 49 participated
+ 2-3 participants is assigned to each product
** Adjustment and Misinterpretaion
+ The responses are reviewed in the cases of:
  + Duplication (55 instances)
  + The pacipant use "Does not apply" to indicate that they cannot find an example of the guideline (73 instances)
  + The pacipant use "Does not apply" to indicate a violation (20 instances)
  +ke clear  The participant misinterpretes one guideline to another
* Phase 3: User Study (Results)
** *Clarity and Clarifications*
  + Some guidelines are rephrased for more clarity
  + Examples:
    + G1: "Make capabilities clear" --> "Make clear /what/ the system can do"
    + G2: "Set expectations of quality" --> "Make clear /how well/ the system can do what it can do"
* Phase 3: User Study (Results)
** Evolution of guidelines 1 and 2

* Phase 4: Expert Evaluation
+ Experts: peoples who have experience in UX/HCI who are familiar with discount usability methods
+ 11 experts are recruited: 6 UX designers, 3 UX researchers, 2 in research and product planning roles
+ Experts are asked to asked to review 9 revised guidelines and chose what they prefer

* Discussion
** There is are tradeof between generality and specialization
+ The guidelines might not be able to address all types of AI-infused system
  + For example, voice-based AI, activity trackers
+ Design guidelines that can be easily evaluated from the interface are focused on.
  + Ex: Broarder principles such as "build trust" is excluded

* Some guidelines
** G1: Make clear what the system can do :ATTACH:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       665a82cb-2d19-4744-9df1-d92b30a09ab6
:END:
+ Help the user understand what the AI system is capable of doing
+ Category: Initially
+ Example: Activity Trackers
  + All metrics that it tracts is displayed and explained how

* Some guidelines
** G4: Show contextually relevant information.
+ Display information relavent to the user's current task and environment
+ Category: Durring interaction
+ Example: Web Search

* Some guidelines
** G10: Scope when in doubt.
+ Engage in disambiguation or gracefully degrade the AI system's services when uncertain about a user's goal
+ Category: When wrong
+ Example: Autocomplete
  + Usually 3-4 suggestion is provided instead of directly completing

+ Category: Overtime
+ Example: Music Recommenders, Video Recommenders
