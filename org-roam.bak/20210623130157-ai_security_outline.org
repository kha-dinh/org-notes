# * Data Management
# This stage contains the acquisition of data for training
# ** Attacks
# *** Poisoning
# ** Defenses
# *** Detect Poisoning
# *** Preprocessing
# *** Cryptography
# *** Differential Privacy
# ** Security Analysis
# For cloud-based deployment, mostly the model is trained /before/ the deployment or trained without any interference


# Online learning / reinforcement learning can where data is trained continuously can have problem
# * Model Learning
# ** Attack
# ** Defenses

# ** Security Analysis

# * Model Verification
# ** Defenses
# *** Model Fuzzing
# ** Security Analysis

# * Model Deployment
# ** Attacks
# *** Adversarial examples / Model evasion
# *** Membership inference
# *** Model Inversion
# *** Model Extraction
# ** Defenses
# *** Detection of adversarial examples
# *** Obfuscation
# *** Differential Privacy
# *** Cryptography
# *** Trusted Execution Environments
# ** Security Analysis
