#+title: LLVM Passes

* Pass dependencies
There are two types of dependency:
+ *Explicit dependency*, which is established through a direct use of a pass analysis information. For example, this line of code set up the dependency of a user to the DominatorTree pass:
    #+begin_src C++
    DominatorTree &DT = getAnalysis<DominatorTree>(Func);
    #+end_src
+ *Implicit dependency*: Sometime a pass have to be right after some transformation pass. This type of dependency have to be set up using the /pass manager/.
