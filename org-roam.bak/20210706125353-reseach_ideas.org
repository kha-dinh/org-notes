#+title: Reseach Ideas


* Using SW Isolation for Mobile Agent Systems
+ Mobile agent is not getting adopted due to several fallbacks



* Fine-grain access control for multi-party data analytic for data with SGX
+ Maybe a finer grain access control for data
+ Multi-party computation have each party contribute their data to train a shared model, while keeping each party's data
+ Ryoan (cite:hunt2016ryoan) and Chiron (cite:hunt2018chiron) let service provider untrusted provider train model by using software isolation and TEE
  + Ryoan Employ a binary access control mechanism: Use DAG for one-shot policy
    + Service providers can communicate, but in a restricted way
  + Chiron allows service provider to train models without leaking data, but no data access control
+ EnclaveDB (cite:priebe2018enclavedb) protect data by storing all data inside SGX enclave
+ cite:ohrimenko2016oblivious propose using a central trusted cloud to collect data from multiple parties and train the global model
  - Coarse access control of data: each party own their own data
+ [[id:2e19fc10-2640-4d41-b5da-8bf0940b64b3][Attribute-based Encryption]] allow data owners to define access control policy over ciphertext for data users
  - Enhancments include revocable, accountable, updateable, hidden
+ DuetSGX (cite:nguyen2020duetsgx) remove the need for a centralized data curator by sending user data to an enclave that only serve DUET queries, which are queries that [[file:20210706143224-differential_privacy.org][Differential Privacy]] constraints.
+ Possible extension: temporal?

* Proof-of-data
+ Same as blockchain's proof-of-work, but in AI model: it proof that a user contributed data to train that model
+ Problem:
  - Privacy?
* PIM
** Memory monitor with PIM
+ PIM can capture all memory accesses (that is cache miss)
+ How can we utilize cache misses for security?
+ How do we insert cache-miss?
  1. Force cache-miss:
     1. Insert clflush (high overhead)
     2. ??
  2. Insert uncached regions

    

** PIM secure storage
+

** PIM secure memory allocator
+ Can an allocator collaborate with PIM for security?
  - Probably not, allocator use virtual addresses
  - Most secure allocator use randomize allocation
