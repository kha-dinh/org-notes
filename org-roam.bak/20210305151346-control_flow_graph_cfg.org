#+title: Control Flow Graph (CFG)
#+tags:compiler

* Overview
+ A Hybrid [[file:20210305142947-intermediate_representations.org][Intermediate Representations]]
+ Represents the program structure
+ Generated from [[file:20210305144307-abstract_syntax_tree.org][Abstract Syntax Tree]] or a sequential list of statements
+ Composed of a set of *Basic blocks*
* Basic blocks
- The longest possible sequence of straight-line statements
  + No branch in/out inside the block
  + Single entry point
  + Single exit
* Construction of CFG from basic blocks
+ Given N basic blocks, a CFG is built by creating a set of /directed edges/ E that connect the blocks
+ A directed edge (N_{i}, N_{j}) is created if
  - There is a conditional / unconditional jump from N_{i} to N_{j} OR
  - N_{j} is an immediate sucessor of N_{i} AND the last statement of N_{i} is not unconditional jump
+ If the program exits/start at multiple nodes, intermediate nodes are created
  - connected to original entry/exit node
* Optimizations with CFG
** Unreachable Code Elimination
+ Use a graph search algorithm (DFS or BFS) to traverse the CFG
+ Mark visited nodes
+ Other unmarked nodes are removed.
** Edge Classification
+ Useful in some analyses
+ Construct a Deph-First-Spanning-Tree on CFG
+  Classifies 4 types for edges:
  - Tree edge: Edges belongs to the spanning tree
  - Forward edges: edges not belong to DFST to a descendant
  - Back edges: edge not belong to DFST to an ancestor
  - Cross edges: edges not belong to DFST to neither ancestor or descendant
** Dominance Relation
+ A relation that indicates which block always precedes which blocks after the entry
+ Useful in /common subexpression elimination/ (CSE), code movement
+ Given $ G = (N, E,s) $ and two nodes $ d, n \in N $
  - s: entry node
  - N, E: Nodes, edges
  - d *dominates* n (d *dom* n) if every path from s to n goes through d
  - d *strictly (properly) dominates* n if d *dom* n and d != n
  - d *immediately dominates* n (d *idom* n) if d is the last dominator of n
    + d then *properly dominates* n and any other node k which *properly dominates* n and d
    s -- k -- d -- n
              ^
*** Lemmas
1. s *dominates* all node of G reachable from s
2. n *dom* n
3. Dominance relation have partial ordering
   a. Reflexive: n dom n
   b. Transitive: n dom m ^ m dom k => n dom k
      s -- n -- m -- k
   c. Anti-symmetric: n dom m ^ m dom n => n = m
4. Dominators of a node forms a chain
*** Algorithm
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def find_all_doms(G):
    dom(entry) = {entry}
    # Put all nodes in the dom set
    for all n in N-{entry}:
        dom(n) = N
    while any dom(n) changes:
        for all n in N-{entry}:
            for all predecessors p of n:
                # AND with the predecessors
                dom(n) = dom(n) ^ dom(p)
            # Add itself to the set
            dom(n) = dom(n) v {n}
#+END_SRC
*** Dominator tree
+ Created from the CFG using the algorithm
+ T = (N,E_{D},s)
  - E_{D} is a set of edges (n,m) such that n *idom* m
+ Properties
  - A node dominates it self and its descendants
  - A note immediately dominates its child nodes
*** Common Subexpression Elimination with Dominance Relation
+ When d is a common dominator of blocks n_{1} and n_{2}
  - e.g. dom(n_{1}) \cap dom(n_{2}) = d
+ We can mode the common computations fron n_{1} and n_{2} to block d
+ /example/:
  n_{1}: x = a + b;
  n_{2}: y = a + b;
 Becomes
  d: t = a + b;
  n_{1}: x = t;
  n_{2}: y = t;
*** Code Movement with Dominance Relation
+ Some compiler optimizations such as prefetching try to move operations to the earliest point possible to account for the delay
  - The operation can be moved to its *immediate dominator* if _data dependency is not violated_
    + It can be repeatedly moved again to the next immediate dominators
** Posdominance Relation
+ A relation that indicate which blocks always comes after which block to the exit
+ u *postdominates* v if every path from v to the exit goes through u
+ u *immediate postdominates* v if v the first dominator of v
** Loop
+ Loops are made from back edges
  - Loop entry: Node with a predecessor not in the loop
  - Loop exit: a node with a successor not in the loop
*** Natural Loops
+ for a back edge (m \rightarrow n), n *dom* m
  + e.g. loop with 1 entry point
+ Most loops from high level construct are natural loops
*** Strongly Conencted Components (SCC)
+ Is a subgraph G_{SCC} = (N_{SCC}, E_{SCC})
+ For any node u,v from N_{ssc}, a path from u to v and v to u always exist
** Alias Analysis & Point-to Analysis
+ *Must vs. May Information*
  - *Must* information: information true on *all* paths through CFG
  - *May* information: information true on *some* paths through CFG
+ *Flow Sensitive vs. Insensitive*
  + *Flow-insensitive* information: information is true *everywhere* on a CFG
  + *Flow-sensitive* information: information is true on a specific point (basic block) on a CFG
+ Two variable are *aliased* if they use the same storage location
  - Causes in programming (=union= type, pointers, call-by-reference)
+ To know pointers point to which object
+ Context-sensitive vs. Insensitive:
  + Sensitive: Different information on different call sites
  + Insensitive: Merge all call site
*** Flow-Sensitive Alias Analysis
+ DFA: =f(I) = (I - {(x,t)} | any variable t}) \cup {(x, new_p)}=
+ More expensive but more precise
*** Flow-Insensitive Alias Analysis
+ Inclusion-based: use subset
+ Unification-ased: use equaliy
+ Less expensive, less precise
