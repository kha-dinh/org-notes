* Access pattern based attack
+ Predict label of input data by observing access pattern of a DNN
** Steps
1. Use its own input to collect memory access pattern & correspoinding output
2. Train a logistic regression classifier using memory patterns & output
3. Collect memory access trace during attack
4. Use trained classifier to predict output
