#+title: CPU Caches

+ From: [[file:20210514124450-arm.org][ARMageddon: Cache Attacks on Mobile Devices]]
* Cache set
+ Cache lines are organized in *sets*
+ Each memory address maps to one of the sets
  + Addresses that map to the same set are /congruent/
+ Congruent addresses compete for the same set with a /replacement policy/ (eviction policy)
 + Some replacement policies
  - Intel: Least-recently used (LRU)
  - ARM use pseudo-LRU for L1, pseudo random replacement for L2
* Cache index
+ Can be virtually or physically indexed using a /tag/
  - A tag identifies the address that is cached in a cacheline
* Cache inclusiveness
+ /Inclusive cache/: cacheline from lower levels are also stored in higher level
+ /Exclusive cache/: a cache line is only in one level at a time
+ /Non-inclusive/: neither inclusive nor exclusive
* Cache coherence
+ Coherence protocol is used to synchronize cache of multiple CPU cores
