#+title: GPU Virtualization


* Techniques
+ *API remoting*: Provides a GPU wrapper library to a guest OS to intercept GPU
  calls. Requests are forwarded to the host OS or machine with GPUs and
  processed remotely. This solves black-box GPU drivers.
+ *Para-virtualization*: Slightly modifies the GPU driver at the guest to forward
  sensitive operations to he host OS. Have better performance compared to
  virtualization.
+ *Full Virtualization*: Fully virtualize the GPU, so no guest modification needded.
+ *Hardware-supported Virtualization (GPU pass-through)*: Allow guest OS direct
  access to GPUs using feature provided by motherboard chipset of GPU
  manufacturers. Enabled by remapping DMA and interrupts to each guest OS. Most
  cannot multiplex between multiple multiple GPU users.
