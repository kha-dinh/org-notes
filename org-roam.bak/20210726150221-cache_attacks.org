#+title: Cache Attacks



* PRIME+PROBE
cite:liu2015lastlevel
+ Attack on LLC does not require sharing cores or memory
+ Develop an algorithm to probe exactly one cache set without knowing virtual-address mapping
+ Use =temporal access pattern= to identify security-critical accesses
+ Attack steps:
  a. At $t_{0}$, the attacker /primes/ the cache (fill the entire cache with data)
  b. At $t_{1}$, execute code with /memory accesses dependent to sensitive data/
  c. At $t_{2}$, /probes/ which of attacker's cache line got evicted
     + -> those are used by the victim
     + Commonly use access time to measure evicted cacheline
     + Attacker know the mapping of the victim -> know which address is access.


* SGX Cache attack

+ Use privileged sw to PIN victim process to a single core
+ based on PIM+PROBE
