#+title: Three Address Code

* Basics
- Is a type of linear [[file:20210305142947-intermediate_representations.org][Intermediate Representations]].
- In general, it has statements in the form
  $ x \leftarrow y op z $
  + With 1 operator (op) and at most 3 names (x,y,z)
- More complex operations are broken down into simpler Three Address Codes:
  $ z \leftarrow x - 2 * y $ becomes
  $ t \leftarrow 2 * y $
  $ z \leftarrow x - t $
* Characteristics
  + Resemble assembly languages
  + Introduce new set of names
  + Compact form
* Naive representation
+ Use a table of k * 4 small integers
+ Each records a operation / name / value
| load  | r1 | y  |    |
| loadi | r2 | 2  |    |
| mult  | r3 | r2 | r1 |
| load  | r4 | x  |    |
| sub   | r5 | r4 | r3 |
+ Similar to asm code
