#+title: Bypassing memory safety mechanisms through speculative control flow hijacks
#+FILETAGS: :paper:

+ Use speculative execution to bypass stack smashing protection and control flow integrity in memory safe languages (go, rust)
+ Works by overwriting backward / forward edge, followed by speculative code reuse to leak data
