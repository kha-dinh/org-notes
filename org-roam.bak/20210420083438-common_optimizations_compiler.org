#+title: Common Optimizations (Compiler)

[[file:20210304170921-compilers.org][Compilers]]
+ Performing one optimization enable other optimizations
+ Typically performed until no further optimization could be done.
* Constant Folding
+ Compute known value at compile time
+ In general: If there is a statement $x:=y op z$ and x,y are constants
  - Then $x op y$ can be computed at compile time
+ /example/:
  x = 2 + 2 ---> x = 4
  if (2 < 0) can be removed
* Algebraic Simplication
+ Delete redundant operations
  - x = x + 0, x = x * 1, ...
+ Or simplify
  - x = x * 0 ---> x = 0
  - x = x ** 2 ---> y = y * y
  - x = x * 8 ---> x = x << 3 (may faster than *)
  - (x - y ) + (x - y) ---> 2 * x - 2 * y ( may overflow )
* Copy Probagation
+ Replace copy with the value itself
  /ex/: if $w = x$ appears in a block, then all uses of w can be replaced with x
+ For *Global copy propagation*: use SSA form, replace copied value
* Constant Propagation
+ Replace simple assignment with constant
+ For *Global copy propagation*: use SSA form, replace copied value
+ Does not make the program smaller or faster, but enable:
  + Constant folding
  + Dead code elimination
  + Algeabraic simplicfication
* Value Numbering
+ Eliminate computation if already done before
  - VN(n): Assign an ID to each expression (n)
    + VN(x+y) = VN(j) iff x+y and j have same value for all paths
+ Algorithm:
  - For each operation x = <operatior,y,z>
    + Get VN for <operation,y,z> from hash lookup: Hash<operator,VN(y),VN(z)>
    + If x already have a VN, replace x with reference to VN
      /ex/:
       a0(3) = x0(1) + y0(2)
       b0(3) = x0(1) + y0(2) -> b0 = a0
  - For simple assignment (x = y, x = const)
    + Simply assign the same VN for const/copy propagation
** Dominator Value Numbering
+ Use hash table from idom(x)
** Global Value Numbering
+ Use [[file:20210311211156-data_flow_analysis.org][Data Flow Analysis]] to find congruent sets of variables
+ Two nodes are congruent of a value graph if:
  - They are the same node
  - Or same constant contents
  - Or same operator and congruent operand
* Redundancy Elimination
** Unreachable Code Elimination
+ If $w := rhs$ appears in a basic block and
  $w$ does not appear anywhere else
  then $w := rhs$ is _dead_ and can be eliminated
** Partial Redundancy Elimination
+ When a expression is evaluated along some path but not all paths
+ Eliminate:
  - Discover partial redundancies
  - Convert to full redundancies
  - Remove
** Common Subexpression Elimination
+ Assume Basic block in SA form
+ All assignments with the same =rhs= compute the same value.
  /example/:
  x = y + z
  w = y + z -> w = x
+ *Dominance in CSE*: If b1 dom b2 then b2 can be fully redundant
+ *Global CSE*:
  + Solve "available expression" using DFA, them preplace common expressions with temp value
** Code Motion
*** Loop invariant code motion:
+ *Loop invariant*:
  + Where operands are all constants
  + Operands are all defined outside of the loop
+ Expressions are always safe
+ Assignment are not safe
  - Conditional execution or early exit
  - Raise exception
  - (v = expression) Can only be hoisted if:
    + Assignment dominate all uses of v in the loop
    + Assignment dominates all exit blocks of the loop ( No early exit )
*** Unification
+ If expressions are always evaluated after some point, move them to the *latest common dominator*
