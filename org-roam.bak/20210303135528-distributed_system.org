#+title: Distributed System

* Basics
+ Is a collection of computers that behave like a single system
+ Need to have *Autonomous* components that collaborate with each other
+ A *Middleware* layer used to connect different machines, it offers local OSes and Applications the same interfaces.
* Some characteristics of Distributed systems:
** There is no global state
    - Processes have no up-to-date knowledge of other processes state.
    - Problem: Termination and deadlock detection
** There is no global clock
    - Problem: Mutual exclusion
    - There have to be protocols to synchronize the clock between distributed processes [[file:20210303201334-clock_synchronization_distributed_system.org][Clock Synchronization (Distributed System)]].
    - Alternatively, the system can have a [[file:20210308230800-coordinator_distributed_system.org][Coordinator (Distributed System)]]
** Nondeterminism
    - Problem: Race conditions
** Prone to failure
** Limited bandwidth
** Latency
* *Advantages* of building distributed systems:
  + More economical
  + Fully utilize parallel algorithms
* Goals
+ Make resources accessible
+ Better scalability / performance
+ Transparent to distribution
* Distribution Transparency:
  - Access Transparency
  - Location Transparency
  - Migration & Relocation Transparency
  - Replication Transparency
  - Concurrency Transparency
  - Failure Transparency
* Scalabillity Problems:
+ Size scalability
+ Geographical scalability
+ Administrative scalability
* Techniques for scaling
1. Hiding communication latencies
2. Distribution
3. Replication
   a. Caching

+ Sometimes data store have to replicated to different nodes. Consistency have to maintained between replicas.
