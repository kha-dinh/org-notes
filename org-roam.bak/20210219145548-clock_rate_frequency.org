#+title: Clock Rate (Frequency)

Clock rate is the frequency at which the processor can generate pulses. Measured in *clock cycles per second* ( or Hz). It indicates a processor's speed.

When two devices with different clock rate communicate with each other, it is call *clock domain crossing (CDC)*.

A fully synchronous design (a.k.a *Globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GAL)*) is a circuit that can operate on safely on its own clock rate in a system with different clock domains.
