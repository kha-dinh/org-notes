#+title: Loop in LLVM

* Definition
All loops in LLVM are /natural loops/
A loop is a subset of nodes from the CFG with the properties:
1. The induced subgraph is [[file:20211028175148-strongly_connected_components_scc.org][Strongly Connected Components (SCC)]]
2. All from outside into the loop's nodes must point to the loop header. This make the loop header /dominates/ all nodes in the loops
3. The loop is the maximum subset with these properties. That is, no mode node can be added so that the graph strongly connected and have same header.
