#+title: Cache Telepathy
* Overview
+ /Reduce search space/ of DNN architectures from cache side-channels
+ Use Prime+Probe & Flush+Reload
+ Attack OpenBLS and Intel MKL library
* Background
** DNN
*** DNN Architecture ( hyper parameters )
+ No. of layers
+ Layer types
+ Connections between layes
+ Hyper-parameters of each layer
  - No. of neurons, no, of filter, filter size,filter stride
+ Activation function (Relu, sigmoid)
*** Weight
*** Usage
+ Inference usually done on CPUs
** Attacks against DNN
+ Most attack /need the DNN architecture/
*** Model extraction attack
+ Estimate weight of the network
*** Membership inference attack
+ Try to infer traning data set
*** Hyper-parameter stealing attacks
+ Steal loss functions and reularization terms
** Cache Side-channels
*** Flush+Reload
+ Map the same code to the attacker process, then determine if the victim has access through timing
*** Prime+Pribe
+ Build /conflit addresses/ which map to the same cache set as victim's line
+ Access conflist address for victim to evict the line, then measure the access latency
* Attack procedure
1. Use cache attack to obtain matrix parameters
2. Infer DNN architecture from matrix parameters
3. Prune search space for DNN architecture
