#+title: Timeline of Security


* Timeline
** 1970s
=The access control schemes are invented. Also, the birth of public crypto system is in this period=
+ Multi-user OS is becoming popular
  - Access control models
    + Multi-level security
    + Bell-LaPadula, Biba
+ DES encryption
  - Key distribution is needed
  - Cryptanalysis
+ Public-key crypto system
  - Diffie-Hellman, Merkle-Hellman, RSA
+ Key distribution
** 1980s
=Security evaluation criteria are introduced. Moreover, software protection is first discussed=
+ The Orange book (1985)
+ X.509 PKI: the standard of public key system
+ IBM PC
  - Software copy protection
  - Floppy disk virus
+ Internet is introduced ->  Morris worm
** 1990s
=Era of cryptography and authentication. More methodological approaches to security research are developed=
+ Cryptography is widely adapted
  - Cellular networks: GSM
  - Open-source cryptography: PGP
  - Password sniffers -> SSH
  - Commercial Internet -> SSL & VeriSign CA
+ PKI is criticized for its trust in a centralized party
  - Trust management researches
+ Biometric authentication
+ Intrusion detection techniques are developed
+ Macro virus
+ DRM techology

** 2000s
=Era of vulnerability analysis=
+ Fast spreading internet worms
  - Secure programming methodology
  - Secure programming language
  - Security analysis and testing tools
+ Botnets, spyware
  - Malware analysis
+ Phishing
+ Enterprise identity management
+ Security in mobile networks
+ Mobile device OSes
+ User's privacy

** 2010s
=Era of application security=
+ IoT
+ Cloud Computing
+ Big data security
+ Mobile app security
+ Usable security
+ Smart grid security
+ Smart cars
+ Targeted attacks
+ Hactivism (use computer to promote political)
+ Blockchain
** 2020s
+ Security using AI
+ Security of AI (adversarial of machine learning)
+ Hardware security
+ Security for decentralized environments
