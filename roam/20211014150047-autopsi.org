+ [[id:f9de9f38-b09e-44aa-ac59-8290350368b1][Program Slicing]] is kind of related, in that only the instructions that are
  related to the sensitive instructions are "sliced" out, thus minimizing
  the TCB while maintaining the correct execution.
+ There are also papers that perform [[id:143f7d86-1750-417d-b7af-fde0be7ae95e][Program Partitioning / Compartmentalization]].
+ It use [[id:8b7d6034-5fed-408f-9430-182073debece][Intra-process Isolation (IPI)]] to achieve the isolation of the sensitive
  compartments.
