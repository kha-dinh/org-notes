#+title: Fuzzing

* What
+ to repeatedly running a [[id:42ff8ed1-85b7-46bf-9a8e-146462c07fe0][Program Under Test (PUT)]] with input sampled from a "fuzz input space".
  + Sampling don't need to be randomized
  + fuzz input space might not contains the expected input space
+ [[id:2d5ed360-3721-4f69-a670-e4100ae9f413][Fuzz Testing]] is a use case of fuzzing that focus on finding bugs in software
  + Use a [[id:e31b3e4e-fdff-41c9-84f7-4cc40266c420][Bug Oracle]] to determine wheter an input / execution of a PUT trigger an error.
+ [[id:e02cfba5-545a-4b3b-9f2d-8b5e0d3f4078][Anatomy of Fuzzers]]
+ Types of fuzers:
  + [[id:b3a3d964-e62f-4154-8f74-31c45b86ee7a][Black-box Fuzzers]] does not see the internals / source code of the [[id:42ff8ed1-85b7-46bf-9a8e-146462c07fe0][Program Under Test (PUT)]]
  + [[id:b3375e75-870f-4464-b95e-d2bd9ab69c79][White-box Fuzzers]] are able to see and analyze the internal behaviors of the PUT
  + [[id:a5ec503f-f936-46cf-8ee4-1c7ccc8dab98][Grey-box Fuzzers]] might only use high-level information about the execution of PUT, such as code coverage
