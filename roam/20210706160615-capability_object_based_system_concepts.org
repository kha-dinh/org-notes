#+title: Capability-based & Object-based System

* Summary
+ Provides:
  - Single mechanism to address both primary and secondary memory
  - Single mechanism to address HW and SW resources
+ A capability is a =token= that give the processor permission to access an =entity= in a computer system
+ Capability is implemented in a data structure that contains: =unique object identifer= and =access rights=
  - Identifier is address or name of an object
  - Access right define operations that can be perform on the object
+ Each user/process have a =list of capabilities=: all of object that process can access
  - Each capability in the list /identify the object/ and /indicate if the operation is permitted/
+ Capabilities is used for object protection, so system must inhibit programs from directly modify its capability
  - Capability is only modifiable by hardware or operating system
+ Operations of capability system:
  + Move capability in a list
  + Delete
  + Restrict rights
  + Pass to a procedure
  + Transmit to another user
+ A user can have several capability lists in multi-level
