#+title: ARMageddon: Cache Attacks on Mobile Devices

* Info
+ Published: USENIX 2016
+ Authors: Moritz Lipp

* Abstract
- Cross-core chache attacks on /non-rooted android without privileges/: Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, Flush+Flush
- Can monitor cache activity in TrustZone from normal world

* Challenges in attacking ARM devices:
+ LLC on ARM are not inclusive -> cannot do cross-core attack
+ Have multiple CPUs that do not share cache
+ Do not have a flush instruction
+ Use pseudo-random replacement policy to decide which cacheline to replace
+ Cycle-accurate timings require root access
* Background
** [[id:ce77b344-a252-4347-a98f-8761037f7dfa][CPU Caches]]
** Cache attacks
*** Evict+Time:
1. Measure execution time of victim
2. Evict a cache set
3. Measure the execution time again
*** Prime+Probe:
1. Occupy cache sets
2. Schedule victim program
3. Deterime which cache sets are still occupied
*** Flush+Reload:
1. Map binary(shared object) into address space
2. Flush cache line (code or data)
3. Schedule victim program
4. Check if cache line has been loaded
+ Allows attacker to determine which exact instructions are executed and which data is accessed
* Design
** Solving non-inclusive cache
+ Cache is non-inclusive, but shared memory is coherent across cores
  - Remote cache access is done on shared memory instead of memory access
+ To perform cross-core attack, load data into cache to evict L1 and L2 cache
** Cross-CPU attack
+ Due to coherence, CPU request remote core fetch instead of memory request, which are faster
** Fast evict strategy
+ Find eviction strategyies using automated way in ([[id:49f833e8-1454-4907-8c62-e0c4120f7581][Rowhamer.js]])
+ Eviction set computed based on physical addresses gotten from /proc/self/pagemap

** Timing strategy
