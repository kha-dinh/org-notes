#+title: Research As A Group Activity

- Some people think research should be done individually.

* Principles
 + Any activities should encourage (1)
   + Building one's own knowledge
   + Spreading the knowledge to others
   + Developing ideas
 + Efficient communication (2)
   
* Activities
** Meeting
Each meeting should have a clear purpose (2). It should stop right after we answer all of the questions
*** Paper Discussion
+ Paper discussions should only happens after all have read the paper?
*** Paper Presentation
+ Should this be an activity?
*** Ideal Discussion
*** Project Discussion
** Paper reading
*** Shared reading
 + Shared reading provide more ground for discussions
 + Maybe good for very important papers / foundational papers
 + Individual reading allows for faster reviewing. However, knowledge must be shared for individual reading to be effective.
*** Individual reading
+ Since it is impossible for one to read all of the materials,
+ Documentation is necessary (1)
+ 1. What background knowledge the paper use
+ 2. Its relationship to other papers.
  + Which paper it improves upon, which methods from other papers did it use?
  + Strength / weakness compared to other paper
+ Key ideas
** Continuous Discussion

* Types of knowledge
** References / Reading material
+ There should be three types of references:
  + *Foundational*
  + *Land marks*
  + *State-of-the-art*
** Documentations
+ Tutorials
+ Insights
+ Notes
+ Meeting notes
   

* Rounds of paper review
Maybe paper review should be in several rounds?

First round: Paper summary, ..., emphasize on its relationship to other works

Second Round: Other people ask questions
Third Round: Other people ask questions about paper
