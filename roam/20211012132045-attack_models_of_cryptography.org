#+title: Attack Models of Cryptography


* Ciphertext only attack
+ The attacker only have access to the ciphertexts and want to infer the underlying plaintext.
+ The attack is =passive= in nature
+ Usually based of frequency analysis
* Known plaintext attack
+ Attacker have some ciphertext and plaintext pair
* Chosen plaintext attack (CPA)
+ The attacker can get the ciphertext of any plaintexts of its choice by the use of an /Encryption Oracle./
+ It use a list of plaintext and ciphertext to infer the encryption algorithm
+ Trivia: CPA is used to break German ciphertext in WW2 by Alan Turing.
** Semantic Security
+ Given ciphertext generated from different message, an adversary cannot "/efficiently/" distinguish between two different message, or learn about any information from a ciphertext.
  + e.g., deducing the LSB of plaintext from a ciphertext
+ Advantage: $Adv_{ss}[A,Cipher] = |Pr[m = 0] - Pr[m = 1]|$
+ Stream cipher are secmatically insecure under CPA ([[id:1db3d4da-1f08-4863-a8d0-2fd7cd5b962e][Attack Models of Cryptography]])
+ If E(k,m) always produces the same ciphertext, then cipher is insecure under CPA
+ Common rule for CPA security
  + Do not use EBC
  + Always use random IV (for CBC)
  + Do not use constant keys
  + No constant salt for password-based encryption (PBE)
  + No fewer than 1000 iterations for PBE
  + No static seeds for secure random

  + CTR is the best and most modern encryption (for privacy only)
    + Only insecure if non is reused
    + But not against CCP
* Chosen ciphertext attack (CCA)
+ Use a ciphertext chosen by attacker to get the decrypted plaintext (by an /decryption oracle/)
+ In real world, obtaining the decryption oracle is easier in real life.
+ Lunchtime attack (CCA1)
  - Attacker can only queries until a certain point
  - And cannot adapt their queries

+ Adaptive chosen-ciphertext a(CCA2)
  - Ciphertext is chosen adaptively based on the results of previous queries
