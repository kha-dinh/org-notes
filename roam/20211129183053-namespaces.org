#+title: Namespaces

Namespaces are features of [[id:e5af5024-4c70-41cc-84aa-f55afbefb15f][Linux]] that partition the kernel resources such that each process has different view on the system resources.
Every process within the same namespace appears to have the same isolated global resources. Changes to resources within the same namespace is invisible to other namespaces, and vice-versa.
