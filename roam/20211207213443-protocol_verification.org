#+title: Protocol Verification

* What
+ Protocol verification try to apply [[id:a95ebb8d-5019-45be-b248-bb5a5b76e78a][Formal Methods]] to prove that a [[id:ce9bd7a5-909c-4469-95c8-26bc1658741f][Security Protocols]] is secure
+ There are the Computational approach and the Symbolic approach
+ The methods are based on an abstract [[id:9702b3d0-f329-4a4b-af99-584016d4c843][Model]], could fail to protect some attacks
* Computational Approach
+ Represent data as bit strings
* Symbolic Approach
