#+title: Capability List (c-list)

* Overview
Capability List is one method to implement [[id:a69fbd5e-dd46-4b5f-a9c4-46213051cf14][Capability-based & Object-based System]] in operating systems.
It store the list that contains id, access right inside a protected memory (usually the kernel memory). Any use of the capability must be done implicitly ([[id:ffcb6258-1291-4101-9e2d-7b97a9908967][Implicit vs. Explicit capabilities]]) through the kernel.

The use of c-list requires protected memory that cannot be tampered by the user.

A user can have several capability lists in [[id:b0bda531-8fd4-4138-86aa-e297fb628855][Multi-level Security Models]]
