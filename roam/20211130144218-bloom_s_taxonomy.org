#+title: Bloom's Taxonomy

* Taxonomy :ATTACH:
Is a framework proposed by [[id:a63952a6-ba7e-4424-8f76-739b91f2b984][Benjamin Bloom]] to categorize the [[id:a65ac379-e373-49d5-b132-3c5fa31f5657][Learning]] goals. In this taxonomy, the higher level of learning requires the lower goals.
However, the higher goals will also develop the lower level goals.
When learning about something, one should make the higher goals the objective.
For example, to analyze something, it is necessary to apply, understand, and remember it.
