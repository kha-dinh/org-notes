#+title: Multi-level Security Models
* What
+ Multi-level Security is a [[id:acd3fa27-05fc-45df-8bdb-d611663ef452][Security Models]] assign different level for each [[id:75d75440-02a2-41f3-8095-cc02c46ff69b][Objects]] and [[id:bdc7d211-d5cb-4f72-920d-9ddf1f8042ae][Subjects]]
+ Each Object and Subjects has [[id:b6373223-4222-45bc-bb2a-0954c4964308][Security Labels]] that indicate the security level (e.g., TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, UNCLASSIFIED)
+ For objects, there are levels of classification
+ For subjects, there are levels of clearances
+ Is a [[id:7256e571-0502-46f2-bf48-460705d82338][Mandatory Access Control (MAC)]] policy

* Definition
+ The model is defined in term of [[id:75d75440-02a2-41f3-8095-cc02c46ff69b][Objects]] (=O=) and [[id:bdc7d211-d5cb-4f72-920d-9ddf1f8042ae][Subjects]] (=S=)
  - O has a classification
  - S has a clearance
  - The security level is denoted by L(O) and L(S)

* Basic security theorem
+ A state transition is secure if both initial and final states are secure
+ If all state transition are secure and the initial state is secure, then every subsequence states will be secure

* Models
+ [[id:d8dd35bc-9276-4a3c-8492-7522a7d5c836][Bell-LaPadula Model]]
+ [[id:2cbbbeb9-0f69-4e10-a4b0-655728f10c2f][Biba Model]]
