#+title: Parallelism in ORAM

* What
+ [[id:88b69192-014f-427d-aa88-6949d34949d4][Oblivious Storage]] achieve parallelism (conccurency) by handling requests concurrently when possible
+ If not handled correctly, there could be information leak (noted by [[id:1badc1cf-7d22-4cfd-8cdb-753bfad1ee21][CURIOUS (Bindschaedler, CCS '15)]]). If accesses to the same blocks are sequentialized, the time would be slower than independent blocks which could be done concurrenly.
+ [[id:1badc1cf-7d22-4cfd-8cdb-753bfad1ee21][CURIOUS (Bindschaedler, CCS '15)]] and [[id:2522318b-6774-4587-ae19-9c485209e0e0][TaoStore (Sahin, S&P '16)]]
introduces concurrency model.
