#+title: Parallelism in ORAM

* What
+ Many research works has been done to achieve parallelism in [[id:83e1d468-29df-4e78-9fb2-02433eb69fa4][Oblivious RAM (ORAM)]], mostly in the aspect of allowing multiple clients to query the ORAM at once.
+ Some use a [[id:7bd760ed-9b60-455f-a872-373ebbcbd7de][Trusted Proxy]] (an [[id:88b69192-014f-427d-aa88-6949d34949d4][Oblivious Storage]]) to schedule ORAM requests of multiple users
+ Some assume [[id:8273d2ab-183a-4047-b8ee-08a2071c9d47][Inter-client Communication]] to synchronize between the clients
