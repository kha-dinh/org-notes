* Movable masses
+ Major movable masses of the figure are the head, the ribcage and the pelvis.
+ The masses moves based on their connection joints
* Wedging, passing and locking

+ The muscle move the joints in any way that the joint can permit.
+ The brain instinctively assume a position
+ The muscle twist and bend the masses by contraction. In doing so, they expand, shorten and bulge.

+ The muscles may make smaller wedges, or connect larger masses together
+ Muscles may pass into, over and around another. May fold in or spread out.
+ The layering of muscle creates the sense of interlocking / wedging in the figure.
