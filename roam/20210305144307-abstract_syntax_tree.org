#+title: Abstract Syntax Tree

+ Is a type of structural [[id:e87d9b01-6c61-4114-a671-e79e058b7d3e][Intermediate Representations]].
+ Is a parse tree ([[id:5b0c852c-c63f-43f0-88f5-c35999ab852e][Parser (Compiler)]]) with all non-terminal nodes removed.
+ Can be represented as *Linearized form* ,which is easier to manipulate compared to tree form:
  * /example/: x - 2 * y can be represented as
    + Postfix form ( x 2 y * - )
    + Prefix form ( - x * 2 y )
+ a *Directed acyclic graph* (DAG) is an AST with a unique node for each value
  - Can encode sharing of expressions
