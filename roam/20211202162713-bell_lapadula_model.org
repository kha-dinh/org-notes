#+title: Bell-LaPadula Model

* What
+ In this [[id:b0bda531-8fd4-4138-86aa-e297fb628855][Multi-level Security Models]], information only flows up, not down. e.g.,
  - Only read down is allowed: [[id:bdc7d211-d5cb-4f72-920d-9ddf1f8042ae][Subjects]] S can read [[id:75d75440-02a2-41f3-8095-cc02c46ff69b][Objects]] O if L(O) <= L(S)
    + A subject can only read object with the same or lower level
  - Only write up is allowed: S can write O if L(S) <= L(O)
    + No write down: an subject cannot leak information
+ Focus con [[id:9a164582-4780-428c-bf28-ede09520c5fd][Confidentiality]]
+ Using this model, a system that start in a secure state will end in a secure state

* Limitation:
** Cascade problem
+ The same label might means different things for different systems.
** Composability
+ When an output is used as the Input?
** Covert Channels
+ Communications channels unseen when enforcing the model is allowed
** High cannot write to low
+ Which is common in real systems (for example error messages)
+ Can be solved by introducing [[id:bdc7d211-d5cb-4f72-920d-9ddf1f8042ae][Subjects]] inside [[id:80c80cc4-9279-4464-8c5b-0a366e7f225c][Trusted Computing Base (TCB)]] can be that is allowed to "write down"


* TODO Introducing Tranquility Property
 - Strong Tranquility: Security labels never change
 - Weak tranquility: Security label can change if it does not violate "established security policy"
 - To implement, we use "high watermark principle",  ich update the security label of a subject to the highest label of resource that it
