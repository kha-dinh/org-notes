* Performance Model for PIM accelerated ORAM
** Online through
** Online Latency
+ Online latency is defined as time of request until time the request is satisfied
+ In [[id:f98986c1-3090-4362-ac1e-89192956cc26][RingORAM (Ren, Sec '15)]], it is the time of request until data is fetched into the stash & returned to client
+ $Online latency = \Delta + time read path$
  + $t_{read path}= \alpha * logN * block size (bytes)$
  + With XOR technique:
    + $t_{read path}= \alpha * N * block size (bytes) + t_{storage}$
    + $t_{storage}= \beta * logN * block size (bytes)$

+ Offline latency = time evict + time early reshuffle
