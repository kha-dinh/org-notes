#+title: LLVM Intrinsic Functions

* What are LLVM Intrinsic functions
+ LLVM intrinsic functions provides a mechanism to extend LLVM without changing all of the passes, because they are transparent to optimization passes.
+ Are useful when the desired functionality can be generally expressed as a function all.
+ The intrinsic function name must start with the "llvm." prefix, which is reserved in llvm.
