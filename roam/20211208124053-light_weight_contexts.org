#+title: Light-weight Contexts

* Overview
+ The author introduced a new [[id:dd3948f1-ba47-421c-af8c-e5054f1708b0][Operating System]] abstraction called the light-weight contexts (lwCs)

+ That provides independent units of protection, privilege and execution state within a process.
+ Each process have different
  + memory view through their own page mappings
  + [[id:0cfddc8b-11e2-414d-92f7-9b0c2feb2d81][File Descriptor]]
  + access capabilites.
+ The overhead is proportional to the amount exclusive memory of each lwC
+ lwCs switching is faster than kernel thread switching?

+ They evaluate some common usage:
  + Fast roll-back
  + Session isolation
  + Sensitive data isolation
  + In-process [[id:5f0bd81f-222c-4023-8c28-10640e32d570][Reference Monitor]]
