#+title: ObliviStore (Stephanov, S&P '13)

* What
+ Is an [[id:88b69192-014f-427d-aa88-6949d34949d4][Oblivious Storage]] implemented using [[id:90671cb6-2eb5-4c4b-944d-a2d69286a386][Partition-based ORAM]]
+ Enable naive concurrency that have vulnerabilities.
+ Based on [[id:8c1bb6c5-a9a1-4f67-9ec3-75d71a7ae737][SSS ORAM]]
+ Stores encrypted blocks in $O(\sqrt(N))$  partitions
  + Each partition have $O(logN)$ levels.
    + Each level have 2, 4, 8, ..., $O(sqrt(N))$ blocks
  + A new level have half encrypted real block and half dummy blocks
+ Client need to store $O(sqrt(N))$ blocks and PosMap of N blocks
+ Introduce "Level compression" to reduce the bandwidth of eviction by half
