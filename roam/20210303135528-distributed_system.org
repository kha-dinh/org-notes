#+title: Distributed System

* Basics
+ Is a collection of computers that behave like a single system
+ Need to have *Autonomous* components that collaborate with each other
+ A [[id:44dc3a46-921e-4991-96af-444e953f3f21][Middleware]] layer connect different machines, it offers local OSes and Applications the same interfaces.

* Some characteristics of Distributed systems:
** There is no global state
 + Processes have no up-to-date knowledge of other processes state.
 + Problem: Termination and deadlock detection
** There is no global clock
 + Problem: Mutual exclusion
 + There have to be protocols to synchronize the clock between distributed processes [[id:d2cef90e-1212-4812-89ab-641c643fd134][Clock Synchronization]].
 + Alternatively, the system can have a [[id:ec702e96-667e-4a8c-b881-19757f7c6085][Coordinator]]
** Nondeterminism
+ Problem: there is no synchronization methods between tasks on different systems
+ Race conditions
** Prone to failure
** Limited bandwidth
** Latency
* *Advantages* of building distributed systems:
+ More economical
+ Fully utilize parallel algorithms
* Goals
+ Make resources accessible
+ Better scalability / performance
+ [[id:5ba8652c-b3f1-4da1-b25e-072a5ed8304f][Distribution Transparency]]

* Issues
+ Scalabillity Problems:
  + Size scalability
  + Geographical scalability
  + Administrative scalability
  + Techniques for scaling
    + Hiding communication latencies
    + Distribution
    + Replication
      a. Caching
+ [[id:bb94b0ed-e326-4a42-9557-fd577ef4a47c][Distributed Recovery]] : The state of the entire distributed system need to be recovered on failure
+ [[id:a6a02d90-1f01-45ec-a2b2-1775fc279db7][Consistency]]: Sometimes data store have to replicated to different nodes. Consistency have to maintained between replicas.
