#+title: Threats and Security Goals

* Threats
** Common threats
+ Disclosure: Unauthorized access to information
+ Modification: Unauthorized change of information
+ Deception: Acceptance of false data
+ Disruption: Prevention of correct operation
+ Usurpation: Unauthorized control of some part of the system


** Security Goals
*** Confidentiality
Private information is accessible only OT authorized parties
**** Confidentiality vs. Privacy
Privacy only involves personally sensitive information
*** Integrity
*** Availability
*** Other
**** Authorization
Computing resource only accessible to authorized entities
**** Authentication
Assurance that a principal, data is genuine
**** Accountability
Identify principals responsible for past actions

*** To achieve security goals
**** Prevention
To prevent attacks from happenings
Cryptography is used
**** Detection
Detect violation of security policies
**** Deference (detection + penalty)
To defer attacks
**** Recovery
Stop attack, access and repair

* Adversary Models
We need an adversary model to build a basis for attacks and countermeasures.
Elements of an adversary model:
+ Who is the adversary (e.g., users of the system)
+ Security Goals (CIA)
+ Adversary's capability
  - Computing resource
  - Knowledge (key, passwords, other secrets)
  - Opportunity for accessing the system's components (source code, implementation details)
  - Opportunity to control the system's components (using the service, modifying messages)
**  The economic view of adversary models
+ Rational attacker compare cost of an attack with gains from it
+ Rational defenders compare risk of attack with cost of implementing defense
