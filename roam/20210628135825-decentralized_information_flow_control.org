#+title: Decentralized Information Flow Control

The goal is to Computations manipulate /values/, which is stored inside /slot/
(variable, object, storage). Slots can be the /source/ and /sink/ for the
computation. /input channels/ are _read-only_ slots can be used as a source. Value
can be written to a slot or the /output channel/. Output channels are the only way
to move data outside of the system (sink).

Values, slots and channels have /labels/ attached to them, which indicate security
policy. The label of a value cannot change, but a new label can be create on a
copy of a value (/relabel/). Slots and channels cannot be relabeled.
