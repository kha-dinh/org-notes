#+title: Perfect Secrecy

* What
+ Is an attribute of [[id:01f66afd-111b-432f-99c0-51f593d36e5b][Cryptography]] algorithms
+ Perfect Secrecy (Shannon 1949): given a ciphertext c, an attacker cannot determine the message that was the plaintext. That is,
  $PR[E(k,m_{0}) = c] = PR[E(k,m_{1}) = c]$
+ To achieve perfect secrecy, the key length need to be greater of equal than the message length (e.g., One Time Pad).
+ In practice, this is hard to achieve, so most encryption schemes only limit the computational power of the adversary
** Non-perfect secrecy
+ Non-perfect secrecy: Given two ciphertext $c_{1} = k xor m_{1}$ and $c_{2} = k xor m_{2}$
  Attacker can compute  $c_{1} xor c_{2} = m_{1} xor m_{2}$. Therefore, if $m_{1}$ is leak, $m_{2}$ is also leaked.
