#+title: Privilege Separation

* What it is
Following the principle of least privilege, each software component should only
have the smallest amount of privilege that it need.

Typically, privilege separation need [[id:2600bd94-d792-4546-8a24-b98a33ee935a][Memory Isolation]] to isolate the memory
regions of the components.

An example of the principle is in microkernels, where only the minimum amount of
code is inside of the kernel, while most of the functionalities are moved out.
The Chromium browser also isolate each tab into separated sandboxes.
