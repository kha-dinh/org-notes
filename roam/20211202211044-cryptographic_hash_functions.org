#+title: Cryptographic Hash Functions

* What
+ are one-way functions that irreversibly transform a Plaintext into a hash digest.
+ Is useful in creating a digital footprint of the message.
  + Used in [[id:0e32165d-1210-46e5-be42-e6ff97b2f1a6][Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)]]: In stead of authenticating the entire message, only the hash of the message is verified.

* Propertites
+ Pare-image resistance: given a hash, it is hard to find the original message
+ Weak collision resistance: Given a hash, it hard to find another message that produce the same hash
+ Strong collision resistance: It is hard to find any pair x and y such that H(x) = H(y)
