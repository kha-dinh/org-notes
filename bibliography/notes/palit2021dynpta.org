* Summary
+ The paper proposes combining /static pointer analysis/ with /dynamic data flow tracking/. This overcome issues with scalability and precision in pointer analysis.


* asd
+ The main difference with cite:liu2017ptrsplit is that PtrSplit avoid doing global pointer analysis and only do intra-procedural analyses. To track pointers, PtrSplit use type checking (i.e., use the pointer type of the definition and usage to match the pointer usage), which would requires no usage of =void= pointers. This is not the case for real programs such as openssl.
